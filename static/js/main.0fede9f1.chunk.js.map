journey to becoming a JavaScript developer and wrote my very first \"hello world\"\n              I took the self taught route and completed courses on Udemy and created a portfolio of projects to develop my\n              knowledge.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My passion and enthusiasm ensured that I was able to develop my knowledge in a short space of time and by May\n              2020 I was able to write Command Line tools using Node JS and had written<a href=\"https://github.com/Vickicodes/testme\"> my own testing framework</a>. During\n              that time I overcame so many challenges and my journey is not over yet but it is true that practice makes\n              perfect and I understand a little more every day.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I am now a volunteer instructor for <a href=\"https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/\"> Code First: Girls </a>teaching an Introduction to Web Development.

I now have 6 apps included on the\n              projects page of my website and 7 repositories on Github that show examples of my code. I am really proud\n              of the progress I have made, I am so much more confident in my ability now.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I have been working through the newest course that I purchased on Udemy which goes into so much more\n              detail about some of the javaScript methods, the coding challenges that were baffling me before are now\n              easier to break down and overcome.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I am at the point now where I am ready to start applying for jobs. I had been keeping an eye on companies\n              who were actively hiring junior (or associate) developers, but I have noticed that a lot of those roles\n              have been withdrawn due to the situation with Covid-19. These are unprecedented times and no-one knows how\n              long this will go on for or what the long term effect will be on the economy, so I understand why\n              companies are choosing to hold off on recruiting, but for me it feels like a terrible time to be without a\n              job! I knew that finding a job could take a while, but this situation does add extra anxiety.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              On the positive side lockdown does mean I have significantly more time to learn and progress my skills. My\n              new course is with a different trainer and I am loving his way of teaching.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This week (within 3 days) I have created 2 new frontend apps and I am amazed with how quickly I progressed\n              through them. Vij did a code review of my Movie Fight app and asked me lots of questions about the code\n              and what it does, I was able to answer confidently, showing him (and more importantly myself) that I\n              understood what each piece of code was doing.

I sent the app over to a friend for some feedback and when he\n              suggested an improvement I was able to implement it without looking up how. There was a point in this\n              course when I felt that I would never get it, that I would always need to follow along or ask for help or\n              need to be guided to implement anything, so to have been able to implement a solution on my own was an\n              amazing feeling!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My application is far from perfect and there are many more features that I can/want to add but considering\n              I have been coding for 2 months I think I have done an amazing job!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The course may be over but the learning isn't going to stop there.

It is also one of the most\n              popular languages out there and so should make me more desirable to prospective employers.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Before I start my new course though I have a few projects that I have started on and want to finish up so\n              that I can add them to my portfolio which is my plan for next week.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"./blogImages/certificate.jpg\" />\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"blog p-3\">\n            <h2>Week 8 - RESTful, Data persistence and User Authentication</h2>\n            <h5>6 March 2020</h5>\n            <hr />\n            <p>\n              After the rollercoaster of last week this week has been a lot better. I started the week learning about\n              User Authentication using\n              <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/\">PassportJS</a> and then used it in conjunction with Mongodb to set up\n              users on my Campsite Reviews app. I love how Passport takes something as important as password security\n              and makes it simple to implement in apps.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I then went on to learn about RESTful routing and CRUD actions and why it is important to have this\n              consistency on apps to make for a better developer and user experience.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"./blogImages/rest.jpg\" />\n            <p>\n              The remainder of the week was then spent working on my Campsite reviews app, I used bootstrap to make it\n              look nicer and improve the UI, it now has a landing page, an index which shows all the campsites in the\n              database then a show page which give more detail for each campsite. The site has register and login\n              routes, which gives a user the ability to add a new campsite or add a comment to an existing campsite. My\n              favorite bit is that it is a dynamic site, meaning that what you see is dependent on whether you are\n              logged in or not (e.g. the add a new campsite or edit button).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I am really surprised with just how quickly I am progressing and how far I have come in such a short space\n              of time. If I get my head down and work hard I should have completed the course next week, which would be\n              amazing! At the start of the journey I was told that it takes a while to feel like you are learning, well\n              everyday now I feel I have learnt (and understood) something new. I gave myself a target of 1 year to\n              learn before I can apply for a job. I have a feeling that my first job application will be much sooner\n              than that.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"blog p-3\">\n            <h2>Week 7 - Making Things Work</h2>\n            <h5>28 February 2020</h5>\n            <hr />\n            <p>\n              Well this week has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride, some things have gone amazingly and others have\n              gone horribly! But thankfully I am ending the week on a high.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              At the beginning of the week I felt myself losing momentum with the completion of my online course and so\n              I thought, to give myself a bit of a boost, it might be a good idea to do a few coding challenges that can\n              be found online... I was not boosted!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I stuck with easy mode and although I found the first 2 challenges hard I was able to complete them on my\n              own, the third challenge was something else, it was called Letter Changes and the question asked:\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"quote\">\n              <em>\n                Have the function LetterChanges(str) take the str parameter being passed and modify it using the\n                following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet\n                (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and\n                finally return this modified string. Example: (\"hello world\" becomes \"Ifmmp xpsmE\").\n              </em>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I approached the challenge the same way I approached the others, I broke the problem down and started\n              writing the parts that I knew the answer for, then I took to researching the rest. I actually found the\n              complete answer to the problem online and I could have just used that, but it is important to me that I\n              understand how and why the solution works; that is where I seemed to hit a brick wall.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The documentation I read confused me and the more I read the less it all made sense. At this point I\n              closed everything on my computer down and had no intention of going back to it! One of the biggest\n              problems I am facing with learning alone is feeling like I am the only one that finds this hard, somedays\n              I just feel so stupid because I am not getting it.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I did come back to the problem, and with Vij’s support I was able to create my own solution that I\n              actually understood and would be able to create again even if I was given a different context. Sometimes\n              it is so easy to get bogged down in the emotions that I can’t see that I have already achieved so much. I\n              am <strong>not</strong> stupid! I <strong>can</strong> do this!\n            </p>\n            <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Vickicodes/92b40c98bd1b3d54b016c72c39af9a2a.js\" />\n            <p>\n              The highs this week have been great though. I have learnt about Express, EJS, body-parser and databases.\n              As part of my course I am making an app that will become 'Team V’s Campsite Reviews'. In addition I have\n              taken what I have learnt from the course and I am using that to build the back end of my To-Do List app, I\n              have even got it working!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I spent some time building the backend and adding in the database. I did hit some errors and at one point\n              I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why I couldnt create a new todo item, when the problem was that my\n              variable was defined below my create function. I won't be making that mistake again!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              The sense of achievement I feel from getting the app functioning correctly is huge and worth all the lows\n              I have felt this week! I think this feeling must be why developers stick with coding even though it is so\n              hard.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"blog p-3\">\n            <h2>Week 5 & 6 - jQuery and Backend</h2>\n            <h5>21 February 2020</h5>\n            <hr />\n            <p>\n              The past 2 weeks have been a little slow where I haven't achieved quite as much as I would have liked,\n              this is because I have been busy doing fun, non-coding related activities that have taken up quite a bit\n              of time. I am really glad that I took that time off as this process can be quite draining, but I have\n              returned this week feeling much more relaxed. It can't be a coincidence that I seem to be picking things\n              up much better too!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In week 5 I learnt about <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> and how it makes manipulating the DOM so\n              much easier! I have been amazed that this is free and open-source, in fact, one of the most wonderfully\n              surprising things I have found so far with Web Development is how much shared knowledge and free to use\n              libraries there are which designed to make other developers lives easier. This level of support has also\n              been my experience when talking to other developers too; there doesn't seem to be any competition or\n              ruthlessness, which coming from a banking background is so refreshing!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Using jQuery I have built the frontend of a todo list and styled it with{' '}\n              <a href=\"https://uigradients.com/\">uiGradients</a> (yet another great free resource).

I am still a\n              million miles from being comfortable with writing code but every day I can see my progression and that is\n              an amazing feeling! Yesterday the trainer gave me a challenge and I was able to complete 90% of it without\n              asking for any help, I broke each part down, and iterated over those parts until I had a working app. The\n              only part I got stuck on was accessing the data in an object using a variable. I wrote:{' '}\n              <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Vickicodes/bd6a9456054f7a6aead1704ad65d9572.js\" /> when it needed to\n              be : <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Vickicodes/6c0b53a91aa1703d4869cbc4504c4864.js\" /> I am pretty\n              happy with how close I got before needing to ask for help.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              There are times when I am getting ahead of myself though (very typical of me!), I have started on my first\n              big side project, making a budget planner, I thought it would be a good idea to work on the front end. I\n              wrote 387 lines of code using HTML and Bootstrap and my app was broken. Many of my components had the same\n              ID and so wouldn't work with Bootstrap's accordion (and unfortunately it is not a simple case of changing\n              the ID’s, I tried!) - this was very frustrating! I have been told that if I just execute a bit of patience\n              the next part of my course will teach me about a tool that will make building my app so much easier, and\n              so I have put it to one side for now to carry on with my learning.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Oh and one other thing!

I have learnt about different data types, conditionals, functions,\n              arrays, objects and methods, and honestly my head felt as if it was about ready to explode! This part of\n              the course has focused on the basic components of Javascript and has tried to teach me what they do and\n              what their roles are, the instructor calls these the most important and fundamental concepts of\n              JavaScript. So pretty important that I get a strong understanding of them.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Monday I learnt about 'while' and 'for' loops, 'while' loops seemed to click straight away, where as I\n              have struggled to get my head around 'for' loops all week. When the instructor is explaining or going\n              through a loop I feel pretty comfortable, but as soon as I have to write one myself it all goes out the\n              window. I definitely felt like I was stuck in this infinite loop:\n            </p>\n            <script src=\"https://gist.github.com/Vickicodes/e6fd0a1f0c7c832ea1339e9de4ebf084.js\" />\n            <p>\n              By Tuesday evening I felt as though I had taken in so much information that I just couldn't take any more\n              (I had to walk away from the laptop and switch my brain off for a few hours). By Wednesday (when I still\n              couldn’t write a working 'for' loop) I came really close to just giving up completely!\n            </p>\n            <p id=\"helen\" class=\"quote\">\n              \"You only fail if you quit for good!

She is also learning to code and is\n              having the same struggles as I am, talking to her is really helping to keep my morale up.

I have made a few things, including a simple 'To Do List' app\n              and an 'Annoy-o-matic', which asks the user over and over \"are we there yet?\" until they input a keyword.\n              Best of all this morning I wrote a loop, without guidance and it worked!

I met up with one of the\n              girls I have been talking to via twitter (who is also making a career change), spent some time chatting to\n              people who have recently started a job as a developer and I chatted with some of the speakers at the\n              event. I really pushed myself outside of my comfort zone and by the time I got home was completely\n              exhausted, but I am so glad that I went! I came away with lots of connections that I am able to call upon\n              when I need support in different areas and tips that will help me on my journey (and a shed load of\n              stickers!).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              On my course this week I have been learning all about Bootstrap and how this can support frontend\n              development. I have built a few different sites over the past few days, including a photo gallery of\n              images of my dog (which I had a lot of fun making!) but overall I have found this week a bit overwhelming.{' '}\n              <img src=\"./blogImages/gallery.png\" />\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Bootstrap is amazing! It does so much and really makes styling so much easier than writing new CSS for\n              every element, but I don't know how I will ever be able to understand it. I know that I don't need to\n              memorise Bootstrap, but I do need to know <strong>what</strong> it does so that I can understand{' '}\n              <strong>how</strong> it can support my projects; this is what I have found overwhelming.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I really have needed to remind myself that I am only just at the beginning of my journey and that\n              knowledge and learning will come with time. One of the talks at the conference discussed how it takes time\n              to actually <em>feel</em> like we are learning something. I might write those words in big letters above\n              my desk so that when I feel like nothing is going in I remember that it just takes time.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Each week I am following along with my course for 4 days and then on the 5th actually putting what I have\n              learned into a project of my own so that I can see what I have understood, see where my knowledge gaps are\n              and embed the learning into my brain.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My project at the moment is just my website and so I have made a few changes, it doesn't look too\n              different visually (except that it is now over 2 pages and has a Navbar) but it is a lot more responsive.\n            </p>\n            <img src=\"./blogImages/week2screenshot.png\" />\n            <p>\n              For a week when I have really struggled with the idea that “I can do this” putting my learning into\n              practice and seeing how far I have come is really important! I am definitely not finishing the week on as\n              much of a high as last week, but I am still eager to progress along my journey.\n            </p>\n            <p>Next week I start on Javascript!</p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div class=\"blog p-3\">\n            <h2>The first week on my journey to becoming a code master</h2>\n            <h5> 17 January 2020</h5>\n            <hr />\n            <p>\n              So I started the week with my new (to me) Macbook Air and a comfortable workplace, with lots of natural\n              light and my dog sleeping at my feet.

Surprisingly I found that\n              one of my biggest challenges was having moved from Windows to a Mac, my brain just didn’t want to accept\n              [cmd+C] to copy text! It turns out my most searched for subject this week is ‘keyboard shortcuts on a\n              mac’.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              At one point I really couldn't figure out how to make a ‘descendant’ selector work with a ‘nth-of-type’\n              selector, my husband (who has been a web developer for over 10 years) is under strict rules not to give me\n              any answers but he was giving me guidance at this point, when I finally figured it out we both let out a\n              little cheer and he said <strong>“see, you can do this!”</strong> I am really grateful for that\n              encouragement. I am sure that I will come across many of those occasions where I’m feeling like “I’m just\n              not capable” during this learning period, and probably well into my career, but drawing on those around me\n              to be my “cheerleaders” is really going to help!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              There have been lots of other highs too, it felt really good figuring things out and solving problems on\n              my own, I made lots of mistakes and then learnt from them which gave me a real buzz!\n            </p>\n            <p>I have finished the week with my first iteration of my webpage</p>\n            <img src=\"./blogImages/firstweekscreenshot.png\" />\n            <p>\n              I am really proud of how it looks, if you had told me that by the end of my first week I would be creating\n              something that looked like this I would not have believed you, but here it is!
